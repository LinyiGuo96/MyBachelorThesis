# MyBachelorThesis
This repository contains the files related to my undergraduate dissertation. 

First, I am sorry to say that there is no English version of it yet. The final paper is [here](FinalVersion.pdf).

My bachelor thesis mainly focused on the mobile phone user losing problem, which is a pretty common problem existing in different communication companies. So to better prevent from losing customers, what stratedy should they take is a very serious and important problem. Here in my research, I first used survival analysis to help me have an intuition of this problem and then took two methods, the logistic model and the decision tree, to predict whether one customer will loss in the future. Hope you guys enjoy this. 

Btw, feel free to skip the word description if you don't know chinese. The pictures and figures should be able to give you the results intuitively!
